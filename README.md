# Overview

This has two parts.  


# Text_Compare (Text_Compare.py)
- This will take a PDF or docx file and compare the text similarity in a folder of similar files.   Or, it will just compare the text similarilty of document files (docx or PDF) in a folder.   The output file path and filename is up to you.

# Write_Differences (Write_Differences.py)
- The second part is to take two documents and it will look at the first document, then look at the second document.  The output will be a copy of first document and it will highlight (in yellow) the text which is present in both files.  

# ADMIN NOTE:
I realize these are not perfect, but they are free and always double check the work.
